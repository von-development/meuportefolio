MISSING API ENDPOINTS:

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL MISSING:
â€¢ Payment Methods CRUD (table exists but no API)
â€¢ Company Details retrieval (for stock research)
â€¢ Index Details retrieval (for index funds)

ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE MISSING:
â€¢ Subscription management (Premium upgrade exists but no subscription CRUD)
â€¢ Historical price charts (AssetPrices table underutilized)
â€¢ Advanced asset filtering (by sector, industry, country)

ðŸŸ¢ NICE TO HAVE:
â€¢ Asset price import/update endpoints
â€¢ Bulk operations for portfolios
â€¢ Advanced reporting endpoints

REDUNDANT/UNUSED FUNCTIONALITY:
â€¢ Some stored procedures may not be used
â€¢ Views might be over-engineered for current API needs

# 6. Business Logic Recommendations
Write-Host "`n=== BUSINESS LOGIC RECOMMENDATIONS ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan

PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:

ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY - Implement Missing Core Features:
1. Payment Methods API (table exists, no endpoints)
   - GET /users/{id}/payment-methods
   - POST /users/{id}/payment-methods
   - PUT /users/{id}/payment-methods/{id}
   - DELETE /users/{id}/payment-methods/{id}

2. Company/Index Details API (for asset research)
   - GET /assets/{id}/company-details
   - GET /assets/{id}/index-details
   - GET /assets/companies (list with filters)
   - GET /assets/indices (list with filters)

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Enhance Existing Features:
1. Subscription Management API
   - GET /users/{id}/subscription
   - PUT /users/{id}/subscription (modify/extend)
   - DELETE /users/{id}/subscription (cancel)

2. Enhanced Asset Price Management
   - POST /assets/{id}/prices (admin only)
   - GET /assets/{id}/price-history (already exists)

ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Consider Removing Unused:
1. Review if all stored procedures are needed
2. Consider consolidating similar views
3. Evaluate if all columns in tables are used

REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS:
â€¢ FundTransactions + Transactions: Both track different types - KEEP BOTH
â€¢ CompanyDetails + IndexDetails: Different asset types - KEEP BOTH
â€¢ Multiple price-related tables: Serve different purposes - KEEP ALL
